                The second dish I will introduce to you is a Japanese-style 
                chicken curry. Japanese-style curry is characterized by a 
                sauce thicker than most other ethnic curries with a sweeter 
                flavor profile. The spice of the curry broth is also slightly 
                toned down. Simply serve over rice ^_^ a scrumptious, 
                healthy dish with classic flavors that I like to enjoy with eggs.
            </p>
            <p>
                This recipe demands that you use chicken drumsticks or thighs. 
                Many curry recipes ask for the use of chicken bouillon, but I will 
                be avoiding that because of its high sodium content. To 
                produce an alternative to the bouillon, the drumsticks and/or 
                thighs will be airfried and have the resulting melted-off fat 
                for use in the curry broth.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole bulb of garlic</li>
            <li>1 whole onion</li>
            <li>
                Your preference of butter, to sautee above onion and garlic - 
                I would recommend being very liberal with your amount and 
                possibly prepare extra on the side.
            </li>
            <li>4 tbsp flour</li>
            <li>2 tbsp curry powder</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/V8-Original-100-Vegetable-Juice-64-fl-oz-Bottle/15570918">
                1/3 cup V8 Original Vegetable juice</a></li> 
            <li>A thumb width-length of whole ginger</li>
            <li>1 apple, without core</li>
            <li>600 ml water</li>
            <li>1 tsp instant coffee</li>
            <li>1 tbsp worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp ketchup</li>
            <li>8 chicken thighs or drumsticks</li>
            <li>1 blender</li>
            <li>An amount of potatoes and carrots you desire</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First, we will air fry the chicken. Score each chicken appendage 
                with a knife, but leave the chicken skin on. Place
                your chicken thighs/drumsticks in the air fryer. A cooking time 
                of 400 degrees F will suffice for 24 minutes, flip the chicken 
                over halfway through. No marinade is needed for the chicken, they 
                will go into the curry for about 2 minutes once the mixture is done 
                cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, peel the ginger. Place the ketchup, worcestershire sauce, 
                instant coffee, water, apple, ginger, and V8 Vegetable juice into 
                a blender. Blend until the mixture is as liquid as possible, and 
                set aside. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce your potatoes and carrots to a size and cut suitable for 
                a stew.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare your onion and garlic as you desire for sauteeing. Once done, 
                begin to melt your butter in your pot of choice. You will want to 
                choose a pot with considerable width and depth, so you can fit in 
                your potatoes and carrots.
            </li>
            <li>
                After your butter is melted, sautee your onion and garlic to your 
                desired doneness. I prefer my onion and garlic with a noticeable brown 
                tinge. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, add the curry powder and flour to the sauteed onion and garlic. 
                Sautee this mixture under low-medium heat for about 1 minute. 
                I would suggest bringing an extra fork to scrape off the bits of 
                curry powder and flour that stick to your sautee tool. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the mixture in your blender to the pot and mix until the sticky 
                garlic/onion/flour/currypowder mixture is integrated into the liquid. 
                For about 5 minutes, let this mixture cook while you mix it. The mixture 
                will stick to your pot, so make sure you're scraping the bottom for 
                these 5 minutes intermittently. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring the mixture to a boil and add your potatoes. Cook the potatoes 
                on low-medium heat with the pot lid closed for 23 minutes. Stir and 
                scrape the bottom of the pot every 1.5 minutes, quickly so that the 
                heat stays trapped in your curry.
            </li>
            <li>
                After those 23 minutes, add your carrots and cook the curry for another 
                3 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add your crispy chicken thighs or drumsticks to the curry, mix, and 
                the dish is now ready to be served.
            </li>
        </ol>
