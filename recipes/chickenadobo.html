        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                First, I will introduce you to a classic Filipino dish 
                called chicken adobo :3 It is my favorite dish and has been
                since I was around 15 or 16. Around that age, I learned to
                appreciate the sweet undertones of brown sugar under 
                the dish's strong foreground provided by bay leaves and 
                large amounts of garlic. This dish makes me feel very 
                comforted, content, and sleepy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dish can be made with other protein sources such as 
                pork or beef, but the use of chicken thighs or drumsticks provides 
                the stew's broth with a thick consistency as a result of 
                dissolved amounts of chicken skin. Consequently, my favorite 
                substitute for chicken thighs is pork belly. Using beef 
                as an alternative protein source is my lowest preference 
                because of the relatively low amounts of fat in beef cuts 
                compared to chicken thighs or pork belly.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole bulb of garlic</li>
            <li>1 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup vinegar</li>
            <li>3 tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>6 bay leaves</li>
            <li>8 chicken thighs or drumsticks</li>
            <li>Virgin olive oil to sautee, as preferred</li>
            <li>1/2 onion</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First, we will prepare the marinade. Start by combining
                the soy sauce, vinegar, water, sugar, and bay leaves.
                The bay leaves will be left whole.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, take apart the bulb of garlic. Remove the skin off
                each clove and leave all the cloves whole. Leaving the 
                cloves whole will allow us to retrieve individual cloves 
                from the finished stew and use them as condiments for our 
                rice!
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the garlic cloves to the marinade along with the chicken. 
                Leave the skin on, so that the fat will melt off in 
                the cooking process and thicken the soup. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Let the resulting mixture marinate for 30 minutes to an hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, choose your cooking pot of choice. You will want to be 
                able to sear the 8 thighs in the pot comfortably, so make 
                sure the pot has considerable depth and width. You will also 
                want the pot's lid to have an open space for steam to come 
                out of.
            </li>
            <li>
                As the desired marination time approaches, cut the onions 
                to your desired sauteeing preference. In your desired amount
                of olive oil, sautee until onions are caramelized.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the onions have cooked well, add the individual chicken and 
                leave the marinade aside. Slightly sear each chicken appendage 
                until you see a noticeable crisp on the outside of the chicken. 
                My mom said this step would allow moisture to stay inside the 
                chicken after it goes through the following steps.
            </li>
            <li>
                After the thighs are seared to your desire, add the entire 
                marinade into the pot. Ensure that the chicken is mostly 
                submerged in the liquid mixture. Add water if you need to.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook at high heat for about an hour, making sure that steam is 
                comiing out of the pot. If you were unable to find a suitable 
                lid as described in step 5, you may also cook without a lid - 
                just make sure that your stew isn't overflowing.
            </li>
            <li>
                After about an hour, serve the chicken and stew over rice. You can 
                take garlic cloves from the adobo stew and spread them 
                over your rice like butter. The liquid marinade mixture should 
                have reduced heavily, leaving you with a glaze-like liquid 
                sauce! 
            </li>
        </ol>
