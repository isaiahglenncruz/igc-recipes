        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                This is a classic Filipino dish called chicken adobo.
                It is my personal favorite Filipino dish and has been
                since I was around 15 or 16. Around that age, I learned to
                appreciate the sweet undertones of brown sugar under 
                the dish's strong foreground provided by bay leaves and 
                large amounts of garlic.

                The dish can be made with other protein sources such as 
                pork or beef, but the use of chicken thighs provides the 
                stew's broth with a thick consistency as a result of 
                dissolved amounts of chicken skin. Consequently, my favorite 
                substitute for chicken thighs is pork belly.
